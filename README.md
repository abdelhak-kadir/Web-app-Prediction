# Description 
This application integrates two prediction models based on the Iris and Titanic datasets.

The first model uses the Iris dataset to predict the class of iris plants based on their sepal and petal dimensions. Users can input the dimensions of iris flowers into the application, and the model will provide the corresponding class.

The second model uses the Titanic dataset to estimate the survival probability of passengers based on attributes such as class, sex, age, and the number of siblings or spouses aboard. Users can provide this information in the application, and the model will predict the passenger's survival probability.
